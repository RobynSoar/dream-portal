## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the Git editor and pushed to GitHUb to the remote repository 'rpsls-game'

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repository:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are commited.

```git commit -m "commit message"``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready to be pushed.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository 'rpsls-game' on GitHub.

### Deployment to Heroku



### Clone the Repository In GitHub
